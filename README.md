# Web-Scraping-With-Python
I am new to data science. But I am really skillful in writing Python Codes. This time, I try to use limited python libraries to scrape news/information from multiple financial news websites. Please Enjoy!

Till now, I have already use python scripts to fetch data from caixin.com(one of the most powerful and most authoritative 
financial news websites in China) and Wallstreet.cn(my very first endeavor for trying to scrape data from websites)

This branch keeps records of my learning process in cultivating my PYTHON skills in web scraping. Hope you guys can offer me some suggestions. Thanks a lot!!
